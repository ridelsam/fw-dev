# fw-dev
STM32 platform: firmware development project repo

This project is intended to refresh and further my knowledge on entire bare-metal firmware development process.

1. Embedded System Architecture:

Learn how microcontrollers (MCUs) and microprocessors (MPUs) work.
Understand memory types (RAM, ROM, flash, EEPROM).
Get familiar with system buses (address, data, control) and peripherals.
Study interrupt handling and timing.

2. Programming and Debugging:

Master C/C++ for embedded systems.
Learn how to use debugging tools like GDB, JTAG, and SWD.
Understand real-time operating systems (RTOS) and when to use them.

3. Low-Level Programming:

Work with hardware registers and low-level peripherals.
Learn about bit manipulation, timing, and optimization for speed and size.
Understand memory management, including stack, heap, and memory-mapped I/O.

4. Communication Protocols:

Study common communication protocols like I2C, SPI, UART, and CAN.
Understand networking protocols (Ethernet, TCP/IP, etc.) for embedded devices.

5. Firmware Development Workflow:

Learn how to use version control (Git) and build systems (Makefiles, CMake).
Understand the process of flashing firmware to embedded devices.
Familiarize yourself with debugging and testing tools.

6. Power Management:

Study techniques for managing power consumption in embedded systems.
Learn about power modes and techniques like sleep and deep sleep.

7. Design Considerations:

Learn about hardware/software co-design and working with hardware engineers.
Understand safety, security, and reliability concerns in embedded systems.

8. Performance Optimization:

Learn how to optimize code for both performance and memory usage.
Understand timing constraints and real-time systems.
Study profiling and tuning methods.
